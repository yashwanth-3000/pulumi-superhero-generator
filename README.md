## Installation and Setup

### Pulumi Setup

1. **Install the Pulumi CLI**  
   Download and install the Pulumi CLI by following the instructions on the [Pulumi documentation page](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/download-install/). The CLI is essential for logging in, managing stacks, and automating resource provisioning.

2. **Create a Pulumi Account**  
   Sign up for a Pulumi account if you havenâ€™t already. After creating your account, log in via the CLI:
   ```bash
   pulumi login
   ```

### AWS Setup

1. **AWS Account**  
   Ensure you have an AWS account. If you're new to AWS, sign up for a free tier account.

2. **Create an IAM User with Programmatic Access**  
   In the AWS Management Console, create an IAM user with programmatic access. Assign the following policies to ensure full access for deployment:
   - **AmazonS3FullAccess**
   - **CloudFrontFullAccess**
   - **IAMUserChangePassword**

3. **Install and Configure the AWS CLI**  
   Install the AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, region, and output format.

4. **Set Up AWS Credentials for Pulumi**  
   You can provide AWS credentials to Pulumi using one of the following methods:

   **Using Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-id"
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
   export AWS_REGION="your-region"
   ```
   *(If using temporary credentials, also set `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`.)*

   **Or, using a Shared Credentials File:**  
   Follow the instructions in the [Pulumi AWS installation guide](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/aws/installation-configuration/#credentials).

5. **Test Your Configuration**  
   Run the following command to simulate a deployment and verify that your AWS credentials are working correctly:
   ```bash
   pulumi preview
   ```
   If any policy violation errors occur, ensure that your IAM user has the required permissions.

   ```bash
   cd mysite
   ```

3. **Deploy with Pulumi:**  
   Execute the deployment script:
   ```bash
   pulumi up
   ```
   Upon successful deployment, Pulumi will create your AWS resources and provide you with URLs (both HTTP and HTTPS) for your live site.
